// shows a list from array of options, after user is choosing - fires emit to a smart cmp,
// that sends the chosen option to the store and gets new options according to the user request
// for example: ['header', 'footer', 'button'] => emit => store => options of header => renders headers for prev
// or adds directly small elements into workspace (such as txt)
